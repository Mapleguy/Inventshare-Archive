# Inventshare Archive
InventShare was a social media platform intended to allow for users to share, find, and host invention ideas in the public domain.

InventShare was born out of my desire for a place to put my massive, ever growing list of invention ideas. It didn't pan out for a multitude of reasons, but I'm still proud of the website I made for it, even if that website was actually garbage.

Things I learned from doing things right:
1. Overall functionality implementation, including features like photo uploading and post editing
2. LAMP server administration, and just SysAdmin stuff in general using AWS

Things I learned from doing things wrong:
1. EVERYTHING DOESN'T NEED TO BE A PHP FILE, IDIOT
2. Good, responsive design is a MUST
3. JavaScript can be your friend, use it
4. Don't use MySQL for databases that might need to change structure regularly
5. InventShare could have probably benefitted from using a JS framework
6. Security needed some big overhauls, especially with regards to AWS keys
7. Eclipse sucks for web development, IDEA is way better
8. Making things look good early will only bite you when it stops working later on
9. External libraries and tools exist, USE THEM
10. EVERYTHING DOESN'T NEED TO BE A PHP FILE
