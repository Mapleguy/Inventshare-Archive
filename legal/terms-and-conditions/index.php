            <text style="font-family: 'Sansation'; font-size: 1.5vw;">InventShare wants to ensure it maintains a healthy environment.</text></br>
            <text style="font-family: 'Sansation'; font-size: 1.5vw;">Because of this, we have to put in place some rules.</text></br>
            <text style="font-family: 'Sansation'; font-size: 1.5vw;">In order to create an account on InventShare, please read and follow the Terms and Conditions.</text></br>

            affected by the misuse of my inventions by other people.</p></br>
